# Final Pymaceuticals - Analyzing Drug Regimen Results

For this product, two files are opened, merged and analyzed:
.\data\Mouse_metadata.csv
.\data\Study_results.csv

The merged file is then cleaned for a data set that is anomolous.

The output is to indicate:
The results for all drugs tested
* The mean of all the tumors
* The median of all the tumors
* The variance of all the tumors
* The standard deviation of all the tumors
* The SEM of all the tumors
* 

The data is then visualized in bar and pie charts, as well as highlighting outliers and a scatter plot.

Assistance was provided by the TA's of the class and many hours on Google.
